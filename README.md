This is a rendition of Gartic Phone which is a Drawing game where you are givien a prompt and do your best to draw it.
This version of Gartic Phone is made using Next.js as frontend and Springboot.webframework as back end.
For UI development we are using React and Tailwind for styling.
For Routing we are using the React Router to better protect routes.
We plan to use a Whiteboard or Canvas Library called Konva.js.
We plan to use ShadCN to accelerate the Frontend Development.
